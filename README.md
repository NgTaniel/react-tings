# using vite + typescript
The awesome link on how to setup a React App using Vite and Typescript: https://blog.logrocket.com/build-react-typescript-app-vite/

To set up this project, fork this repository to produce your own copy of this project repo, afterwards copy the http link and in your terminal, run `git clone <repo's http link here>`. Afterwards `cd` into the appropriate repository, which should commonly be the name of the repository and run `npm i` to install the necessary packages.

To run the project, the packages that is contained with vite uses dev dependencies, so once you are in the right file path, the main command to run the project is `npm run dev`, and your terminal should display a link that looks something like http://localhost:5173/, which you will open to view the project :D

The great thing about using a devdependencies script is that when you make a change to your project, it will automatically refresh and display your changes to improve efficiency and productivity that includes not needing to refresh your project + terminal (specifically for backend development). Awesome right? :D
